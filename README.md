| **[Efficient representation of 3D spatial data for defense-related applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05109v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability. Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to ensure scalability and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgriGS-SLAM: Orchard Mapping Across Seasons via Multi-View Gaussian Splatting SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26358v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[LODGE: Level-of-Detail Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting with Efficient Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23158v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a novel level-of-detail (LOD) method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time rendering of large-scale scenes on memory-constrained devices. Our approach introduces a hierarchical LOD representation that iteratively selects optimal subsets of Gaussians based on camera distance, thus largely reducing both rendering time and GPU memory usage. We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering, employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk boundaries. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both outdoor (Hierarchical 3DGS) and indoor (Zip-NeRF) datasets, delivering high-quality renderings with reduced latency and memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Web: https://lodge-gs.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[LVD-GS: Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Dynamic Scenes via Hierarchical Explicit-Implicit Representation Collaboration Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22669v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D Radar-Inertial Odometry based on Gaussian Modeling and Multi-Hypothesis Scan Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13639v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are sensors that provide robustness against adverse weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.), and as such they are increasingly used for odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping). However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing registration algorithms, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Following the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting for vision, in this paper we propose a summarized representation for radar scenes based on global simultaneous optimization of 3D Gaussians as opposed to voxel-based approaches, and leveraging its inherent probability distribution function for registration. Moreover, we propose tackling the problem of radar noise by optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, following existing practice we implement an Extended Kalman Filter-based Radar-Inertial Odometry pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian approach is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and results can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/robotics-upo/gaussian-rio-cpp</p></details> |
| **[SaLon3R: Structure-aware Long-term Generalizable 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15072v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable, on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction. To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90% redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

| **[Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13381v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories, without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene composition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV-2025, project page: https://dynamic-ugsdf.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proxy-GS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting via Proxy Mesh](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24421v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voyager: Real-Time Splatting City-Scale Gaussians on Resource-Constrained Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02774v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an emerging technique for photorealistic 3D scene rendering. However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization. In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\times$ speedup and 85\% energy savings with superior rendering quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[FGGS-LiDAR: Ultra-Fast, GPU-Accelerated Simulation from General 3DGS Models to LiDAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17390v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic rendering, its vast ecosystem of assets remains incompatible with high-performance LiDAR simulation, a critical tool for robotics and autonomous driving. We present \textbf{FGGS-LiDAR}, a framework that bridges this gap with a truly plug-and-play approach. Our method converts \textit{any} pretrained 3DGS model into a high-fidelity, watertight mesh without requiring LiDAR-specific supervision or architectural alterations. This conversion is achieved through a general pipeline of volumetric discretization and Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) extraction. We pair this with a highly optimized, GPU-accelerated ray-casting module that simulates LiDAR returns at over 500 FPS. We validate our approach on indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating exceptional geometric fidelity; By enabling the direct reuse of 3DGS assets for geometrically accurate depth sensing, our framework extends their utility beyond visualization and unlocks new capabilities for scalable, multimodal simulation. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/TATP-233/FGGS-LiDAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnIRe: Unsupervised Instance Decomposition for Dynamic Urban Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00763v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Oxford Spires Dataset: Benchmarking Large-Scale LiDAR-Visual Localisation, Reconstruction and Radiance Field Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10546v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset captured in and around well-known landmarks in Oxford using a custom-built multi-sensor perception unit as well as a millimetre-accurate map from a Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems. The raw and processed data, along with software for parsing and evaluation, can be accessed at https://dynamic.robots.ox.ac.uk/datasets/oxford-spires/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJRR.

| **[LOD-GS: Level-of-Detail-Sensitive 3D Gaussian Splatting for Detail Conserved Anti-Aliasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00554v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation, overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstruction Using the Invisible: Intuition from NIR and Metadata for Enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14443v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth, and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI, NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/StructuresComp/3D-Reconstruction-NIR</p></details> |  |
| **[LT-Gaussian: Long-Term Map Update Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01704v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.</p></details> | Accepted by IV 2025 |
| **[GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19718v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stereo 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Outdoor Urban Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23677v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation. However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other 3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiEditor: Controllable Multimodal Object Editing for Driving Scenarios Using 3D Gaussian Splatting Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21872v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception models on underrepresented classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSFusion:Globally Optimized LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Mapping for Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23273v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping, conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges. LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian On-the-Fly Splatting: A Progressive Framework for Robust Near Real-Time 3DGS Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13086v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces Gaussian on-the-fly Splatting (abbreviated as On-the-Fly GS), a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via On-the-Fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. To achieve this, we propose a progressive Local & Semi-Global optimization to prioritize the new image and its neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across previous and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering one of the first practical steps toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[SaLF: Sparse Local Fields for Multi-Sensor Rendering in Real-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18713v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors, preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes, and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/</p></details> |  |

The StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting.

This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>(SIGG...</summary><p>(SIGGRAPH 2025) Paper Video: https://youtu.be/VyWkgsGdbkk Project Page: https://shivangi-aneja.github.io/projects/scaffoldavatar/</p></details> |
| **[FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12894v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent works are restricted to specific hardware setups, either on only low-cost or on only high-end configurations. Approaches aimed at reducing 3DGS memory usage enable rendering on low-cost GPU but compromise rendering quality, which fails to leverage the hardware capabilities in the case of higher-end GPU. Conversely, methods that enhance rendering quality require high-end GPU with large VRAM, making such methods impractical for lower-end devices with limited memory capacity. Consequently, 3DGS-based works generally assume a single hardware setup and lack the flexibility to adapt to varying hardware constraints. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) for 3DGS. FLoD constructs a multi-level 3DGS representation through level-specific 3D scale constraints, where each level independently reconstructs the entire scene with varying detail and GPU memory usage. A level-by-level training strategy is introduced to ensure structural consistency across levels. Furthermore, the multi-level structure of FLoD allows selective rendering of image regions at different detail levels, providing additional memory-efficient rendering options. To our knowledge, among prior works which incorporate the concept of Level of Detail (LoD) with 3DGS, FLoD is the first to follow the core principle of LoD by offering adjustable options for a broad range of GPU settings. Experiments demonstrate that FLoD provides various rendering options with trade-offs between quality and memory usage, enabling real-time rendering under diverse memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that FLoD generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://3dgs-flod.github.io/flod/</p></details> |

Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point Cloud Segmentation of Agricultural Vehicles using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05009v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.</p></details> |  |

By using RGB images, ExploreGS replaces traditional lidar-based point cloud acquisition process with a vision model, achieving a high-quality reconstruction at a lower cost. The framework integrates scene exploration and model reconstruction, and leverags a Bag-of-Words(BoW) model to enable real-time processing capabilities, therefore, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) training can be executed on-board. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the ExploreGS framework on resource-constrained devices, while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Its explicit and discrete representation facilitates the seamless composition of complex digital worlds, offering significant advantages over previous neural implicit methods. However, when applied to large-scale compositions, such as crowd-level scenes, it can encompass numerous 3D Gaussians, posing substantial challenges for real-time rendering. To address this, inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite system, we propose Virtualized 3D Gaussians (V3DG), a cluster-based LOD solution that constructs hierarchical 3D Gaussian clusters and dynamically selects only the necessary ones to accelerate rendering speed. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Offline Build, where hierarchical clusters are generated using a local splatting method to minimize visual differences across granularities, and (2) Online Selection, where footprint evaluation determines perceptible clusters for efficient rasterization during rendering. We curate a dataset of synthetic and real-world scenes, including objects, trees, people, and buildings, each requiring 0.1 billion 3D Gaussians to capture fine details. Experiments show that our solution balances rendering efficiency and visual quality across user-defined tolerances, facilitating downstream interactive applications that compose extensive 3DGS assets for consistent rendering performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://xijie-yang.github.io/V3DG/</p></details> |

Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting Streaming Towards Fast On-the-Fly 4D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14847v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great interest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Existing approaches mainly rely on full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish dynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the fastest on-the-fly training, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

This work presents SAGE (Semantic-Driven Adaptive Gaussian Splatting in Extended Reality), a novel framework designed to enhance the user experience by dynamically adapting the Level of Detail (LOD) of different 3DGS objects identified via a semantic segmentation.

| **[A Hierarchical Compression Technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.</p></details> |  |

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, it leverages LiDAR point clouds to initialize 3DGS, providing a denser and more reliable starting points compared to sparse SfM points. In scene rendering, the framework augments standard image-based supervision with depth maps generated from LiDAR projections, ensuring an accurate scene representation in both geometry and photometry.

In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

To this end, Levels of Detail (LOD) avatar representations such as polygonal meshes, image-based impostors, and point clouds have been proposed and evaluated. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been explored as a potential method for real-time crowd rendering. In this paper, we present a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment that aims to determine the perceived quality of 3D Gaussian avatars. Three factors were explored: Motion, LOD (i.e., #Gaussians), and the avatar height in Pixels (corresponding to the viewing distance). Participants viewed pairs of animated 3D Gaussian avatars and were tasked with choosing the most detailed one. Our findings can inform the optimization of LOD strategies in Gaussian-based crowd rendering, thereby helping to achieve efficient rendering while maintaining visual quality in real-time applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, most prior research has focused on the rendering quality along a pre-recorded vehicle path and struggles to generalize to out-of-path viewpoints, which is caused by the lack of high-quality supervision in those out-of-path views. To address this issue, we introduce an Inverse View Warping technique to create compact and high-quality images as supervision for the reconstruction of the out-of-path views, enabling high-quality rendering results for those views. For accurate and robust inverse view warping, a depth bootstrap strategy is proposed to obtain on-the-fly dense depth maps during the optimization process, overcoming the sparsity and incompleteness of LiDAR depth data. Our method achieves superior in-path and out-of-path reconstruction and rendering performance on the widely used Waymo Open dataset. In addition, a simulator-based benchmark is proposed to obtain the out-of-path ground truth and quantitatively evaluate the performance of out-of-path rendering, where our method outperforms previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</p></details> | Technical report |

With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform. The framework achieves real-time performance while maintaining robust multi-sensor fusion capabilities. All implementation algorithms, hardware designs, and CAD models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the approach introduces coordinate transformations with distortion parameters for camera models to achieve pixel-level alignment between LiDAR point clouds and 2D images, facilitating heterogeneous data fusion and achieving the high-precision geo-alignment required in aerial remote sensing. Depth and plane consistency losses are incorporated into the loss function to guide Gaussians towards real depth and plane representations, significantly improving depth estimation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that our approach has achieved novel view synthesis that balances photo-realistic visual quality and high-precision geometric estimation under aerial remote sensing datasets. Finally, we have also established and open-sourced a dense LiDAR point cloud dataset along with its corresponding aerial multi-view images, AIR-LONGYAN.</p></details> |  |

It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350 FPS.

However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/goldoak/GSFusion.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce LVI-GS, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Visual-Inertial mapping framework with 3DGS, which leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and image sensors to capture both geometric structures and visual details of 3D scenes. To this end, the 3D Gaussians are initialized from colourized LiDAR points and optimized using differentiable rendering. In order to achieve high-fidelity mapping, we introduce a pyramid-based training approach to effectively learn multi-level features and incorporate depth loss derived from LiDAR measurements to improve geometric feature perception. Through well-designed strategies for Gaussian-Map expansion, keyframe selection, thread management, and custom CUDA acceleration, our framework achieves real-time photo-realistic mapping.

Compared to existing methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our approach enables real-time photo-realistic mapping while ensuring high-quality image rendering in large-scale unbounded outdoor environments. In this work, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is employed to mitigate the issues resulting from sparse and unevenly distributed LiDAR observations. The voxel-based 3D Gaussians map representation facilitates real-time dense mapping in large outdoor environments with acceleration governed by custom CUDA kernels. Moreover, the overall framework is designed in a covariance-centered manner, where the estimated covariance is used to initialize the scale and rotation of 3D Gaussians, as well as update the parameters of the GPR. We evaluate our algorithm on several outdoor datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mapping efficiency and rendering quality.

While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://city-super.github.io/octree-gs/</p></details> |

However, ensuring geometric accuracy in outdoor and unbounded scenes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces LI-GS, a reconstruction system that incorporates LiDAR and Gaussian Splatting to enhance geometric accuracy in large-scale scenes. 2D Gaussain surfels are employed as the map representation to enhance surface alignment. Additionally, a novel modeling method is proposed to convert LiDAR point clouds to plane-constrained multimodal Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The GMMs are utilized during both initialization and optimization stages to ensure sufficient and continuous supervision over the entire scene while mitigating the risk of over-fitting. Furthermore, GMMs are employed in mesh extraction to eliminate artifacts and improve the overall geometric quality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in large-scale 3D reconstruction, achieving higher accuracy compared to both LiDAR-based methods and Gaussian-based methods with improvements of 52.6% and 68.7%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction often fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, we introduce LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting framework for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate data acquisition. Using this Polar device, we present the GarageWorld dataset, consisting of eight expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures, which will be made publicly available for further research. Our approach demonstrates that LiDAR point clouds collected by the Polar device significantly enhance a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We introduce a novel depth regularizer that effectively eliminates floating artifacts in rendered images. Additionally, we propose a multi-resolution 3D Gaussian representation designed for Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering. This includes adapted scaling factors for individual levels and a random-resolution-level training scheme to optimize the Gaussians across different resolutions. This representation enables efficient rendering of large-scale garage scenes on lightweight devices via a web-based renderer.

We present LiDAR-3DGS, a novel method of reinforcing 3DGS inputs with LiDAR generated point clouds to significantly improve the accuracy and detail of 3D models. We demonstrate a systematic approach of LiDAR reinforcement to 3DGS to enable capturing of important features such as bolts, apertures, and other details that are often missed by image-based features alone. These details are crucial for engineering applications such as remote monitoring and maintenance. Without modifying the underlying 3DGS algorithm, we demonstrate that even a modest addition of LiDAR generated point cloud significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the models. At 30k iterations, the model generated by our method resulted in an increase of 7.064% in PSNR and 0.565% in SSIM, respectively. Since the LiDAR used in this research was a commonly used commercial-grade device, the improvements observed were modest and can be further enhanced with higher-grade LiDAR systems. Additionally, these improvements can be supplementary to other derivative works of Radiance Field Rendering and also provide a new insight for future LiDAR and computer vision integrated modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the resources needed for training and rendering inevitably limit the size of the captured scenes that can be represented with good visual quality. We introduce a hierarchy of 3D Gaussians that preserves visual quality for very large scenes, while offering an efficient Level-of-Detail (LOD) solution for efficient rendering of distant content with effective level selection and smooth transitions between levels.We introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that allows us to train very large scenes in independent chunks. We consolidate the chunks into a hierarchy that can be optimized to further improve visual quality of Gaussians merged into intermediate nodes. Very large captures typically have sparse coverage of the scene, presenting many challenges to the original 3D Gaussian splatting training method; we adapt and regularize training to account for these issues. We present a complete solution, that enables real-time rendering of very large scenes and can adapt to available resources thanks to our LOD method. We show results for captured scenes with up to tens of thousands of images with a simple and affordable rig, covering trajectories of up to several kilometers and lasting up to one hour.

Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment.

Recent advancements in mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces two challenges, including incomplete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this end, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstruction speed.</p></details> |  |

The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views.</p></details> |  |

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting method has achieved the state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed combining the benefits of both primitive-based representations and volumetric representations. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians that try to fit every training view, neglecting the underlying scene geometry. Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage. We show that our method effectively reduces redundant Gaussians while delivering high-quality rendering. We also demonstrates an enhanced capability to accommodate scenes with varying levels-of-detail and view-dependent observations, without sacrificing the rendering speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://city-super.github.io/scaffold-gs/</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 17 figures |

This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[DART-Vetter: A Deep LeARning Tool for automatic triage of exoplanet candidates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05556v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) > 20 and orbital period < 50 days.</p></details> | <details><summary>Numbe...</summary><p>Number of pages: 24, Number of figures: 8, Article accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal on 2025-05-30</p></details> |
| **[Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20947v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs, there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding, smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401; for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and Galactic structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A self-regulated convolutional neural network for classifying variable stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14877v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational diffusion transformers for conditional sampling of supernovae spectra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03063v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have become the most precise distance indicators in astrophysics due to their incredible observational homogeneity. Increasing discovery rates, however, have revealed multiple sub-populations with spectroscopic properties that are both diverse and difficult to interpret using existing physical models. These peculiar events are hard to identify from sparsely sampled observations and can introduce systematics in cosmological analyses if not flagged early; they are also of broader importance for building a cohesive understanding of thermonuclear explosions. In this work, we introduce DiTSNe-Ia, a variational diffusion-based generative model conditioned on light curve observations and trained to reproduce the observed spectral diversity of SNe Ia. In experiments with realistic light curves and spectra from radiative transfer simulations, DiTSNe-Ia achieves significantly more accurate reconstructions than the widely used SALT3 templates across a broad range of observation phases (from 10 days before peak light to 30 days after it). DiTSNe-Ia yields a mean squared error of 0.108 across all phases-five times lower than SALT3's 0.508-and an after-peak error of just 0.0191, an order of magnitude smaller than SALT3's 0.305. Additionally, our model produces well-calibrated credible intervals with near-nominal coverage, particularly at post-peak phases. DiTSNe-Ia is a powerful tool for rapidly inferring the spectral properties of SNe Ia and other transient astrophysical phenomena for which a physical description does not yet exist.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 20 figures |

We directly established a mapping between photometric data and shape distribution through deep neural networks. In addition, we used 3D point clouds to represent asteroid shapes and utilized the deviation between the light curves of non-convex asteroids and their convex hulls to predict the concave areas of non-convex asteroids. We compared the results of different shape models using the Chamfer distance between traditional methods and ours and found that our method performs better, especially when handling special shapes. For the detection of concave areas on the convex hull, the intersection over union (IoU) of our predictions reached 0.89. We further validated this method using observational data from the Lowell Observatory to predict the convex shapes of the asteroids 3337 Milo and 1289 Kuta, and conducted light curve fitting experiments. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of the method</p></details> |  |

ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/uiucsn/ELAsTiCC-Classification).</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 19 figures, 9 tables.

Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>Senso...</summary><p>Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Light-curve Signals with a Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. II. A General Light Curve Classification Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08080v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vast amounts of astronomical photometric data are generated from various projects, requiring significant effort to identify variable stars and other object classes. In light of this, a general, widely applicable classification framework would simplify the process of designing specific classifiers for various astronomical objects. We present a novel deep learning framework for classifying light curves using a weakly supervised object detection model. Our framework identifies the optimal windows for both light curves and power spectra automatically, and zooms in on their corresponding data. This allows for automatic feature extraction from both time and frequency domains, enabling our model to handle data across different scales and sampling intervals. We train our model on data sets obtained from Kepler, TESS, and Zwicky Transient Facility multiband observations of variable stars and transients. We achieve an accuracy of 87% for combined variables and transient events, which is comparable to the performance of previous feature-based models. Our trained model can be utilized directly for other missions, such as the All-sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning. To address known issues with miscalibrated predictive probabilities, we apply conformal prediction to generate robust predictive sets that guarantee true-label coverage with a given probability. Additionally, we incorporate various anomaly detection algorithms to empower our model with the ability to identify out-of-distribution objects. Our framework is implemented in the Deep-LC toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github (https://github.com/ckm3/Deep-LC) and PyPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

Since PLATO's main objective is the detection of temperate Earth-size planets around solar-type stars, the code is designed to detect individual transit events. The filtering step, required by conventional detection methods, can affect the transit, which could be an issue for long and shallow transits. To protect transit shape and depth, the code is also designed to work on unfiltered light curves. We trained the model on a set of simulated PLATO light curves in which we injected, at pixel level, either planetary, eclipsing binary, or background eclipsing binary signals. We also include a variety of noises in our data, such as granulation, stellar spots or cosmic rays. The approach is able to recover 90% of our test population, including more than 25% of the Earth-analogs, even in the unfiltered light curves. The model also recovers the transits irrespective of the orbital period, and is able to retrieve transits on a unique event basis. These figures are obtained when accepting a false alarm rate of 1%. When keeping the false alarm rate low (<0.01%), it is still able to recover more than 85% of the transit signals. Any transit deeper than 180ppm is essentially guaranteed to be recovered. This method is able to recover transits on a unique event basis, and does so with a low false alarm rate. Thanks to light curves being one-dimensional, model training is fast, on the order of a few hours per model. This speed in training and inference, coupled to the recovery effectiveness and precision of the model make it an ideal tool to complement, or be used ahead of, classical approaches.</p></details> | Submitted to A&A |

While tree-based models (e.g. Random Forests) and deep learning models dominate the field, we explore the use of different distance metrics to aid in the classification of astrophysical objects. We developed DistClassiPy, a new distance metric based classifier. The direct use of distance metrics is unexplored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based methods can help make classification more interpretable and decrease computational costs. In particular, we applied DistClassiPy to classify light curves of variable stars, comparing the distances between objects of different classes. Using 18 distance metrics on a catalog of 6,000 variable stars across 10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. Our classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational requirements and improved interpretability. Additionally, DistClassiPy can be tailored to specific objects by identifying the most effective distance metric for that classification. To facilitate broader applications within and beyond astronomy, we have made DistClassiPy open-source and available at https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Computing (2024). 24 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

| **[Multi-modal Loop Closure Detection with Foundation Models in Severely Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05404v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for ICRA 2026</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2025), 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Sensors must contend with abnormal operating conditions: GPS unavailability impedes scene reconstruction and absolute geographic referencing, uneven or slippery terrain degrades wheel odometer accuracy, and long, feature-poor tunnels reduce LiDAR effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose CoalMine-LiDAR-IMU-UWB-Wheel-Odometry (CM-LIUW-Odometry), a multimodal SLAM framework based on the Iterated Error-State Kalman Filter (IESKF). First, LiDAR-inertial odometry is tightly fused with UWB absolute positioning constraints to align the SLAM system with a global coordinate. Next, wheel odometer is integrated through tight coupling, enhanced by nonholonomic constraints (NHC) and vehicle lever arm compensation, to address performance degradation in areas beyond UWB measurement range. Finally, an adaptive motion mode switching mechanism dynamically adjusts the robot's motion mode based on UWB measurement range and environmental degradation levels. Experimental results validate that our method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in real-world underground coal mine scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

For this purpose, a passive 2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose efficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map while the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of mobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a non-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched multi-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and efficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability constraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse, uniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing the sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed Scan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that facilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates. The SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the Translation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for reliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final pose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field metrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well as non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments on a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both global relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, poor propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best, spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in datasets expanding to hundreds of meters.

However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing registration algorithms, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Following the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting for vision, in this paper we propose a summarized representation for radar scenes based on global simultaneous optimization of 3D Gaussians as opposed to voxel-based approaches, and leveraging its inherent probability distribution function for registration. Moreover, we propose tackling the problem of radar noise by optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, following existing practice we implement an Extended Kalman Filter-based Radar-Inertial Odometry pipeline in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experiments using publicly available 4D radar datasets show that our Gaussian approach is comparable to existing registration algorithms, outperforming them in several sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and results can be publicly accessed at: https://github.com/robotics-upo/gaussian-rio-cpp</p></details> |

However, existing methods often face a trade-off between localization accuracy and system robustness in scenarios with a high proportion of dynamic objects, point cloud distortion, and unstructured environments. To address this issue, we propose a neural descriptors-based adaptive noise filtering strategy for SLAM, named ADA-DPM, which improves the performance of localization and mapping tasks through three key technical innovations. Firstly, to tackle dynamic object interference, we design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and filter out dynamic feature points, eliminating the ego-motion interference caused by dynamic objects. Secondly, to mitigate the impact of noise and unstructured feature points, we propose the Global Importance Scoring Head that adaptively selects high-contribution feature points while suppressing the influence of noise and unstructured feature points. Moreover, we introduce the Cross-Layer Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to construct multi-scale neighborhood graphs, fusing local structural information across different scales and improving the discriminative power of overlapping features. Finally, experimental validations on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of ADA-DPM.</p></details> |  |

While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across public and longterm datasets.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec- tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module. Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures. DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy, especially in indoor environments such as long corridors</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS Active Perception Workshop</p></details> |

These challenges lead to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation. This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight, IENC-compatible format. Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly available</p></details> |  |

While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

This leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR, SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous sensor SLAM.

Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by T-RO.

LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms. Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map. To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites, reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14% compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built scene, even under partially constructed conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities: visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against state-of-the-art alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark, while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the art accuracy in the diverse and large-scale sequences from the VBR dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) - Special Issue: Visual SLAM</p></details> |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, and submitted for presentation at a conference</p></details> |

A user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$ overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), benchmarking remains hindered by the scarcity of dedicated multi-robot datasets. Many evaluations instead partition single-robot trajectories, a practice that may only partially reflect true multi-robot operations and, more critically, lacks standardization, leading to results that are difficult to interpret or compare across studies. While several multi-robot datasets have recently been introduced, they mostly contain short trajectories with limited inter-robot overlap and sparse intra-robot loop closures. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CU-Multi, a dataset collected over multiple days at two large outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. CU-Multi comprises four synchronized runs with aligned start times and controlled trajectory overlap, replicating the distinct perspectives of a robot team. It includes RGB-D sensing, RTK GPS, semantic LiDAR, and refined ground-truth odometry. By combining overlap variation with dense semantic annotations, CU-Multi provides a strong foundation for reproducible evaluation in multi-robot collaborative perception tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Towards Robust LiDAR Localization: Deep Learning-based Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18954v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions. Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semantic particle filter that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter. Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features, and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort for supervised approaches.</p></details> |  |

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs.

| **[PINGS: Gaussian Splatting Meets Distance Fields within a Point-Based Implicit Neural Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots benefit from high-fidelity reconstructions of their environment, which should be geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, realising scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We present a novel LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by constraining the radiance field with the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.

| **[Coral: A Unifying Abstraction Layer for Composable Robotics Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02453v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software, Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system integration challenges, improving component reusability, system reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We release Coral open source.</p></details> |  |

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code has been released on https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/Gaussian-LIC.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles. During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures.

One key contribution of this work to 3D LiDAR SLAM and localization is a fierce defense of view-based maps (pose graphs with time-stamped sensor readings) as the fundamental representation of maps. As will be shown, they allow for the greatest flexibility, enabling the posterior generation of arbitrary metric maps optimized for particular tasks, e.g. obstacle avoidance, real-time localization. Moreover, this work introduces a new framework in which mapping pipelines can be defined without coding, defining the connections of a network of reusable blocks much like deep-learning networks are designed by connecting layers of standardized elements. We also introduce tightly-coupled estimation of linear and angular velocity vectors within the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like optimizer, leading to superior robustness against aggressive motion profiles without the need for an IMU. Extensive experimental validation reveals that the proposal compares well to, or improves, former state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR odometry systems, while also successfully mapping some hard sequences where others diverge. A proposed self-adaptive configuration has been used, without parameter changes, for all 3D LiDAR datasets with sensors between 16 and 128 rings, and has been extensively tested on 83 sequences over more than 250~km of automotive, hand-held, airborne, and quadruped LiDAR datasets, both indoors and outdoors. The system flexibility is demonstrated with additional configurations for 2D LiDARs and for building 3D NDT-like maps.

| **[Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual SLAMMOT Considering Multiple Motion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19134v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super LiDAR Reflectance for Robotic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10398v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities, typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR (NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane detection using the generated dense reflectance images.</p></details> |  |

Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the significance of repeatability (precision), despite its importance in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, TaskSLAM-Bench. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet implementation requirements. Simulated and real-world testing scenarios of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance properties of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR SLAM in typical indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 1 table.

Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness. To encourage further research, the code of our Doppler-SLAM and our dataset are available at: https://github.com/Wayne-DWA/Doppler-SLAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Moment Matching-Based Method for Sparse and Noisy Point Cloud Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02187v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, technical report</p></details> |

However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other 3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address these shortcomings and advance development in related fields, the SmartPNT Multisource Integrated Navigation, Positioning, and Attitude Dataset has been developed. This dataset integrates data from multiple sensors, including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), optical cameras, and LiDAR, to provide a rich and versatile resource for research in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation. The dataset construction process is thoroughly documented, encompassing sensor configurations, coordinate system definitions, and calibration procedures for both cameras and LiDAR. A standardized framework for data collection and processing ensures consistency and scalability, enabling large-scale analysis. Validation using state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, such as VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, demonstrates the dataset's applicability for advanced navigation research. Covering a wide range of real-world scenarios, including urban areas, campuses, tunnels, and suburban environments, the dataset offers a valuable tool for advancing navigation technologies and addressing challenges in complex environments.

This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching, exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps. Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds, attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly diverse data interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.

However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets.

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating through such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency components within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a potential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are prone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary exteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are later initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained by the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements into UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of SLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using UWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless areas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses prevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents solutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB AOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient environments.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating semantics provides a richer scene representation that not only enhances localization accuracy in SLAM but also enables advanced cognitive functionalities for downstream navigation and planning tasks. Existing point-wise semantic LiDAR SLAM methods often suffer from poor efficiency and generalization, making them less robust in diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a semantic graph-enhanced SLAM framework, named SG-SLAM, which effectively leverages the geometric, semantic, and topological characteristics inherent in environmental structures. The semantic graph serves as a fundamental component that facilitates critical functionalities of SLAM, including robust relocalization during odometry failures, accurate loop closing, and semantic graph map construction. Our method employs a dual-threaded architecture, with one thread dedicated to online odometry and relocalization, while the other handles loop closure, pose graph optimization, and map update. This design enables our method to operate in real time and generate globally consistent semantic graph maps and point cloud maps. We extensively evaluate our method across the KITTI, MulRAN, and Apollo datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, even in modern SLAM solutions, ICP can degrade and become unreliable in geometrically ill-conditioned environments. Current solutions primarily focus on utilizing additional sources of information, such as external odometry, to either replace the degenerate directions of the optimization solution or add additional constraints in a sensor-fusion setup afterward. In response, this work investigates and compares new and existing degeneracy mitigation methods for robust LiDAR-based localization and analyzes the efficacy of these approaches in degenerate environments for the first time in the literature at this scale. Specifically, this work investigates i) the effect of using active or passive degeneracy mitigation methods for the problem of ill-conditioned ICP in LiDAR degenerate environments, ii) the evaluation of TSVD, inequality constraints, and linear/non-linear Tikhonov regularization for the application of degenerate point cloud registration for the first time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis for least-squares minimization step of the ICP problem is carried out to better understand how each method affects the optimization and what to expect from each method. The results of the analysis are validated through multiple real-world robotic field and simulated experiments. The analysis demonstrates that active optimization degeneracy mitigation is necessary and advantageous in the absence of reliable external estimate assistance for LiDAR-SLAM, and soft-constrained methods can provide better results in complex ill-conditioned scenarios with heuristic fine-tuned parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics</p></details> |

Although multi-sensor fusion approaches integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental conditions. To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has already been accepted to IROS2025. 8 pages</p></details> |

The proposed method performs robust and accurate pose estimation within a continuous-time trajectory optimization framework, while incrementally reconstructing a 3D Gaussian map using camera and LiDAR data, all in real time. The resulting map enables high-quality, real-time novel view rendering of both RGB images and depth maps. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis. Both the dataset and code will be made publicly available on project page https://xingxingzuo.github.io/gaussian_lic2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lidar Variability: A Novel Dataset and Comparative Study of Solid-State and Spinning Lidars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04321v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars, such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar platforms.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots. Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap, we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data. By introducing controlled variations in trajectory overlap and dense lidar annotations, CU-Multi offers a compelling alternative for evaluating methods in multi-robot data association.

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CURL-SLAM: Continuous and Compact LiDAR Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21077v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1]. Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction. Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.</p></details> |  |

The model integrates a learnable component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer that enforces the laws of classical mechanics and consequently improves generalization on out-of-distribution data. The neural-symbolic layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real sensor data that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning, or SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ctu-vras/fusionforce</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Exploration with a New Uncertainty Framework for Active SLAM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17775v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain, allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors, such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore, integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tightly Coupled SLAM with Imprecise Architectural Plans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01737v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots navigating indoor environments often have access to architectural plans, which can serve as prior knowledge to enhance their localization and mapping capabilities. While some SLAM algorithms leverage these plans for global localization in real-world environments, they typically overlook a critical challenge: the "as-planned" architectural designs frequently deviate from the "as-built" real-world environments. To address this gap, we present a novel algorithm that tightly couples LIDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping with architectural plans under the presence of deviations. Our method utilizes a multi-layered semantic representation to not only localize the robot, but also to estimate global alignment and structural deviations between "as-planned" and as-built environments in real-time. To validate our approach, we performed experiments in simulated and real datasets demonstrating robustness to structural deviations up to 35 cm and 15 degrees. On average, our method achieves 43% less localization error than baselines in simulated environments, while in real environments, the as-built 3D maps show 7% lower average alignment error</p></details> |  |

Addressing this need, this paper introduces the VAULT prototype, a ROS 2-based mobile mapping system (MMS) that combines various sensors to enable robust outdoor and indoor localization. The proposed solution harnesses the power of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, visual-inertial odometry (VIO), inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate reliable 3D odometry. To further enhance the localization accuracy, Visual SLAM (VSLAM) is employed, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive 3D point cloud map. By leveraging these sensor technologies and advanced algorithms, the prototype offers a comprehensive solution for outdoor localization in autonomous mobile robots, enabling them to navigate and map their surroundings with confidence and precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to WAF 2023: Workshop de Agentes Fisicos</p></details> |

This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches, Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods, highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes. Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain.

| **[LP-ICP: General Localizability-Aware Point Cloud Registration for Robust Localization in Extreme Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02580v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is a crucial component of LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. However, its performance can be negatively affected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric structures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and mapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric constraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned directions. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained degeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud registration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane distance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and handling. Rather than relying solely on point-to-plane localizability information, LP-ICP enhances the localizability analysis by incorporating a point-to-line metric, thereby exploiting richer geometric constraints. It consists of a localizability detection module and an optimization module. The localizability detection module performs localizability analysis by utilizing the correspondences between edge points (with low local smoothness) to lines and planar points (with high local smoothness) to planes between the scan and the map. The localizability contribution of individual correspondence constraints can be applied to a broader range. The optimization module adds additional soft and hard constraints to the optimization equations based on the localizability category. This allows the pose to be constrained along ill-conditioned directions. The proposed method is evaluated on simulation and real-world datasets, showing comparable or better accuracy than the state-of-the art methods in tested scenarios. Observed variations in partially localizable directions suggest the need for further investigation on robustness and generalizability.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 9 Figures |

Unlike indoor settings, these agricultural environments possess additional challenges due to outdoor variables such as foliage motion and illumination variability. This paper proposes a solution based on 2D lidar measurements, which requires less processing and storage, and is more cost-effective, than approaches that employ 3D lidars. Utilizing the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) metric, the method can solve the scan matching robustly and with high accuracy without needing sophisticated feature extraction. The method's robustness was validated using public datasets and considering various metrics, facilitating meaningful comparisons for future research. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly A-LOAM, show that the proposed approach achieves lower positional and angular errors while maintaining higher accuracy and resilience in GNSS-denied settings. This work contributes to the advancement of precision agriculture by enabling reliable and autonomous navigation in challenging outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

This study unveils a cutting-edge handheld indoor localization system that integrates 2D LiDAR and IMU sensors, delivering enhanced high-velocity precision mapping, computational efficiency, and real-time adaptability. Unlike 3D LiDAR systems, it excels with rapid processing, low-cost scalability, and robust performance, setting new standards for emergency response, autonomous navigation, and industrial automation. Enhanced with a CNN-driven object detection framework and optimized through Cartographer SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping ) in ROS, the system significantly reduces Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 21.03%, achieving exceptional precision compared to state-of-the-art approaches like SC-ALOAM, with a mean x-position error of -0.884 meters (1.976 meters). The integration of CNN-based object detection ensures robustness in mapping and localization, even in cluttered or dynamic environments, outperforming existing methods by 26.09%. These advancements establish the system as a reliable, scalable solution for high-precision localization in challenging indoor scenarios</p></details> |  |

Real-world robots face a wide range of weather conditions (e.g. overcast, heavy rain, and snowing) and most sensors (i.e. camera, LiDAR) essentially functioning within or near-visible electromagnetic waves are sensitive to adverse weather conditions, making reliable localization difficult. In contrast, radar is gaining traction due to long electromagnetic waves, which are less affected by environmental changes and weather independence. In this work, we propose a radar-based lightweight and robust place recognition. We achieve rotational invariance and lightweight by selecting a one-dimensional ring-shaped description and robustness by mitigating the impact of false detection utilizing opposite noise characteristics between free space and feature. In addition, the initial heading can be estimated, which can assist in building a SLAM pipeline that combines odometry and registration, which takes into account onboard computing. The proposed method was tested for rigorous validation across various scenarios (i.e. single session, multi-session, and different weather conditions). In particular, we validate our descriptor achieving reliable place recognition performance through the results of extreme environments that lacked structural information such as an OORD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to RA-L</p></details> |

While cameras and LiDAR are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band radar is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation, providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing operations where near-field detection is critical. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar, which excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework. Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage, derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of \bl{navigation algorithm} estimation difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation, SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime environments.

Benefiting from deep learning, the performance of LiDAR place recognition (LPR) has been greatly improved. However, many existing learning-based LPR methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which severely harms the performance of LPR on previously trained places after training on a new environment. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning framework for LPR via Knowledge Distillation and Fusion (KDF) to alleviate forgetting. Inspired by the ranking process of place recognition retrieval, we present a ranking-aware knowledge distillation loss that encourages the network to preserve the high-level place recognition knowledge. We also introduce a knowledge fusion module to integrate the knowledge of old and new models for LiDAR place recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KDF can be applied to different networks to overcome catastrophic forgetting, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Recall@1 and forgetting score.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter.

Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.

| **[Thermal-LiDAR Fusion for Robust Tunnel Localization in GNSS-Denied and Low-Visibility Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03565v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in autonomous navigation, a critical gap remains in ensuring reliable localization in hazardous environments such as tunnels, urban disaster zones, and underground structures. Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IAVVC 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensively integrated MRNC framework for skid-steer wheeled mobile robots (SSWMRs), in which all components are actively engaged in real-time execution. The framework comprises: 1) a LiDAR-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for estimating the current pose of the robot within the built map; 2) an effective path-following control system for generating desired linear and angular velocity commands based on the current pose and the desired pose; 3) inverse kinematics for transferring linear and angular velocity commands into left and right side velocity commands; and 4) a robust AI-driven (RAID) control system incorporating a radial basis function network (RBFN) with a new adaptive algorithm to enforce in-wheel actuation systems to track each side motion commands. To further meet safety requirements, the proposed RAID control within the MRNC framework of the SSWMR constrains AI-generated tracking performance within predefined overshoot and steady-state error limits, while ensuring robustness and system stability by compensating for modeling errors, unknown RBF weights, and external forces.

While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, preprint, submitted to Robotics And Autonomous Systems</p></details> |
| **[GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19653v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, preprint conference submission</p></details> |

The workflow-centric design uses multiple blocks as the basis for constructing different production lines. The supported applications, i.e., productions avoid redundancy in their designs. Thus, the focus is placed on each block itself for independent expansion. To support all input combinations, our implementation consists of four building blocks that form SceneFactory: (1) tracking, (2) flexion, (3) depth estimation, and (4) scene reconstruction. The tracking block is based on Mono SLAM and is extended to support RGB-D and RGB-LiDAR (RGB-L) inputs. Flexion is used to convert the depth image (untrackable) into a trackable image. For general-purpose depth estimation, we propose an unposed \& uncalibrated multi-view depth estimation model (U$^2$-MVD) to estimate dense geometry. U$^2$-MVD exploits dense bundle adjustment to solve for poses, intrinsics, and inverse depth. A semantic-aware ScaleCov step is then introduced to complete the multi-view depth. Relying on U$^2$-MVD, SceneFactory both supports user-friendly 3D creation (with just images) and bridges the applications of Dense RGB-D and Dense Mono. For high-quality surface and color reconstruction, we propose Dual-purpose Multi-resolutional Neural Points (DM-NPs) for the first surface accessible Surface Color Field design, where we introduce Improved Point Rasterization (IPR) for point cloud based surface query. ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO).

| **[GroundSLAM: A Robust Visual SLAM System for Warehouse Robots Using Ground Textures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05502v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robust visual localization and mapping system is essential for warehouse robot navigation, as cameras offer a more cost-effective alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, existing forward-facing camera systems often encounter challenges in dynamic environments and open spaces, leading to significant performance degradation during deployment. To address these limitations, a localization system utilizing a single downward-facing camera to capture ground textures presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, existing feature-based ground-texture localization methods face difficulties when operating on surfaces with sparse features or repetitive patterns. To address this limitation, we propose GroundSLAM, a novel feature-free and ground-texture-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. GroundSLAM consists of three components: feature-free visual odometry, ground-texture-based loop detection and map optimization, and map reuse. Specifically, we introduce a kernel cross-correlator (KCC) for image-level pose tracking, loop detection, and map reuse to improve localization accuracy and robustness, and incorporate adaptive pruning strategies to enhance efficiency. Due to these specific designs, GroundSLAM is able to deliver efficient and stable localization across various ground surfaces such as those with sparse features and repetitive patterns. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first ground-texture dataset with precise ground-truth poses, consisting of 131k images collected from 10 kinds of indoor and outdoor ground surfaces. Extensive experimental results show that GroundSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both indoor and outdoor localization. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/sair-lab/GroundSLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLACK: Attacking LiDAR-based SLAM with Adversarial Point Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03089v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of learning-based methods for the LiDAR makes autonomous vehicles vulnerable to adversarial attacks through adversarial \textit{point injections (PiJ)}. It poses serious security challenges for navigation and map generation. Despite its critical nature, no major work exists that studies learning-based attacks on LiDAR-based SLAM. Our work proposes SLACK, an end-to-end deep generative adversarial model to attack LiDAR scans with several point injections without deteriorating LiDAR quality. To facilitate SLACK, we design a novel yet simple autoencoder that augments contrastive learning with segmentation-based attention for precise reconstructions. SLACK demonstrates superior performance on the task of \textit{point injections (PiJ)} compared to the best baselines on KITTI and CARLA-64 dataset while maintaining accurate scan quality. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate PiJ attacks using a fraction of LiDAR points. It severely degrades navigation and map quality without deteriorating the LiDAR scan quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Initialization for LiDAR-inertial SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01451v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of the initial state, including initial velocity, gravity direction, and IMU biases, is critical for the initialization of LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems. Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead to failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization is required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of rescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting LiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization methods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective when the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a robust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems (D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU measurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of the LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated within the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion in the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the iterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry. The proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or stationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments demonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various platforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs. D-LI-Init completes dynamic initialization regardless of specific motion patterns. To benefit the research community, we have open-sourced our code and test datasets on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</p></details> |

These scenes come with various challenges, including navigating around crowds of people, dealing with flying plastic bags that can temporarily blind sensors, and addressing reduced LiDAR density caused by cooking smoke. Such scenarios can result in over-degeneracy, causing the map to drift. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-map LiDAR-inertial system (MM-LINS) for the first time. The front-end employs an iterated error state Kalman filter for state estimation and introduces a reliable evaluation strategy for degeneracy detection. If over-degeneracy is detected, the active map will be stored into sleeping maps. Subsequently, the system continuously attempts to construct new maps using a dynamic initialization method to ensure successful initialization upon leaving the over-degeneracy. Regarding the back-end, the Scan Context descriptor is utilized to detect inter-map similarity. Upon successful recognition of a sleeping map that shares a common region with the active map, the overlapping trajectory region is utilized to constrain the positional transformation near the edge of the prior map. In response to this, a constraint-enhanced map fusion strategy is proposed to achieve high-precision positional and mapping results. Experiments have been conducted separately on both public datasets that exhibited over-degenerate conditions and in real-world environments. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of MM-LINS in over-degeneracy environment. Our codes are open-sourced on Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> |

Since training needs to be repeated for each new scene, long training times make these methods impractical for time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving, drones, and robotics. We identify large coverage areas and vast data in large-scale outdoor scenes as key challenges that limit fast training. In this paper, we propose LightLoc, the first method capable of efficiently learning localization in a new scene at light speed. LightLoc introduces two novel techniques to address these challenges. First, we introduce sample classification guidance to assist regression learning, reducing ambiguity from similar samples and improving training efficiency. Second, we propose redundant sample downsampling to remove well-learned frames during training, reducing training time without compromising accuracy. Additionally, the fast training and confidence estimation capabilities of sample classification enable its integration into SLAM, effectively eliminating error accumulation. Extensive experiments on large-scale outdoor datasets demonstrate that LightLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 50x reduction in training time than existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/liw95/LightLoc.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process including a convex-hull-based smoothing and a correlation-based correction. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map by a lidar inertial sequential localizer which supports forward and backward processing. The backward pass enables detailed quantitative and qualitative assessments of reference motion accuracy. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluated several state-of-the-art radar-based odometry and place recognition methods, indicating existing challenges in radar-based SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Digital Beamforming Enhanced Radar Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13252v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in challenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip millimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention thanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low hardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems using traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer from limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the performance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing pipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it to 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal processing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically focus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring odometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems. This research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving more accurate radar odometry by simply replacing the standard FFT-based processing with the proposed pipeline.

Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the "Keep It Small and Simple" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Further, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for further downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In recent years, advancements in LiDAR technology have made sensors more accurate, lightweight, and cost-effective. Therefore, researchers increasingly integrate sensors, for SLAM studies, providing robust technical support for ground robots and expanding their application domains. Public datasets are essential for advancing SLAM technology. However, existing datasets for ground robots are typically restricted to flat-terrain motion with 3 DOF and cover only a limited range of scenarios. Although handheld devices and UAV exhibit richer and more aggressive movements, their datasets are predominantly confined to small-scale environments due to endurance limitations. To fill these gap, we introduce M2UD, a multi-modal, multi-scenario, uneven-terrain SLAM dataset for ground robots. This dataset contains a diverse range of highly challenging environments, including cities, open fields, long corridors, and mixed scenarios. Additionally, it presents extreme weather conditions. The aggressive motion and degradation characteristics of this dataset not only pose challenges for testing and evaluating existing SLAM methods but also advance the development of more advanced SLAM algorithms. To benchmark SLAM algorithms, M2UD provides smoothed ground truth localization data obtained via RTK and introduces a novel localization evaluation metric that considers both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we utilize a high-precision laser scanner to acquire ground truth maps of two representative scenes, facilitating the development and evaluation of mapping algorithms. We select 12 localization sequences and 2 mapping sequences to evaluate several classical SLAM algorithms, verifying usability of the dataset. To enhance usability, the dataset is accompanied by a suite of development kits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Nowadays, LiDAR inertial odometry becomes increasingly prevalent in robotics and autonomous driving. However, many current SLAM systems lack sufficient adaptability to various scenarios. Challenges include decreased point cloud accuracy with longer frame intervals under the constant velocity assumption, coupling of erroneous IMU information when IMU saturation occurs, and decreased localization accuracy due to the use of fixed-resolution maps during indoor-outdoor scene transitions. To address these issues, we propose a loosely coupled adaptive LiDAR-Inertial-Odometry named \textbf{Adaptive-LIO}, which incorporates adaptive segmentation to enhance mapping accuracy, adapts motion modality through IMU saturation and fault detection, and adjusts map resolution adaptively using multi-resolution voxel maps based on the distance from the LiDAR center. Our proposed method has been tested in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the improvements we introduce.

However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Radar is emerging as a valuable sensing tool, especially in vision-obstructed environments, as it is less affected by particles than lidars or cameras. Modern 4D imaging radars provide three-dimensional geometric information and relative velocity measurements, but they bring challenges, such as a small field of view and sparse, noisy point clouds. Detecting loop closures in SLAM is critical for reducing trajectory drift and maintaining map accuracy. However, the directional nature of 4D radar data makes identifying loop closures, especially from reverse viewpoints, difficult due to limited scan overlap. This article explores using 4D radar for loop closure in SLAM, focusing on similar and opposing viewpoints. We generate submaps for a denser environment representation and use introspective measures to reject false detections in feature-degenerate environments. Our experiments show accurate loop closure detection in geometrically diverse settings for both similar and opposing viewpoints, improving trajectory estimation with up to 82 % improvement in ATE and rejecting false positives in self-similar environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, the measurement process is demanding, requiring up to two days per hectare for data collection, significant data storage, as well as resource-heavy post-processing of 3D data. In this work, we present a real-time mapping and analysis system that enables online generation of forest inventories using mobile laser scanners that can be mounted e.g. on mobile robots. Given incrementally created and locally accurate submaps-data payloads-our approach extracts tree candidates using a custom, Voronoi-inspired clustering algorithm. Tree candidates are reconstructed using an adapted Hough algorithm, which enables robust modeling of the tree stem. Further, we explicitly incorporate the incremental nature of the data collection by consistently updating the database using a pose graph LiDAR SLAM system. This enables us to refine our estimates of the tree traits if an area is revisited later during a mission. We demonstrate competitive accuracy to TLS or manual measurements using laser scanners that we mounted on backpacks or mobile robots operating in conifer, broad-leaf and mixed forests. Our results achieve RMSE of 1.93 cm, a bias of 0.65 cm and a standard deviation of 1.81 cm (averaged across these sequences)-with no post-processing required after the mission is complete.</p></details> |  |

However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. In sum, evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables.

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

Ideally, these algorithms should handle efficiently large sizes of Point Clouds under the assumption that using more points implies more information available. The Eigen Factors (EF) is a new algorithm that solves SLAM by using planes as the main geometric primitive. To do so, EF exhaustively calculates the error of all points at complexity $O(1)$, thanks to the {\em Summation matrix} $S$ of homogeneous points. The solution of EF is highly efficient: i) the state variables are only the sensor poses -- trajectory, while the plane parameters are estimated previously in closed from and ii) EF alternating optimization uses a Newton-Raphson method by a direct analytical calculation of the gradient and the Hessian, which turns out to be a block diagonal matrix. Since we require to differentiate over eigenvalues and matrix elements, we have developed an intuitive methodology to calculate partial derivatives in the manifold of rigid body transformations $SE(3)$, which could be applied to unrelated problems that require analytical derivatives of certain complexity. We evaluate the optimization processes (back-end) of EF and other state-of-the-art plane SLAM back-end algorithms in a synthetic environment. The evaluation is extended to ICL dataset (RGBD) and LiDAR KITTI dataset. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/prime-slam/EF-plane-SLAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenLiDARMap: Zero-Drift Point Cloud Mapping using Map Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11111v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate localization is a critical component of mobile autonomous systems, especially in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environments where traditional methods fail. In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong 3D Mapping Framework for Hand-held & Robot-mounted LiDAR Mapping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18110v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a lifelong 3D mapping framework that is modular, cloud-native by design and more importantly, works for both hand-held and robot-mounted 3D LiDAR mapping systems. Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.</p></details> |  |
